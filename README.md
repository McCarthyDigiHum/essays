# ==Othello=={Q26833} Act 1, Scene 1[^1] 
##==Iago=={Q1655364}'s monologue

IAGO:  O, sir, content you.</br>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</br>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</br>
Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark</br>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</br>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</br>
Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,</br>
For naught but provender, and when he’s old, cashiered.

Whip me such honest knaves! Others there are</br>
Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,</br>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</br>
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</br>
Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats,</br>
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</br>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</br>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</br>
Were I the Moor I would not be Iago.</br>
In following him, I follow but myself.</br>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</br>
But seeming so for my peculiar end.</br>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate</br>
The native act and figure of my heart</br>
In complement extern, ’tis not long after</br>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</br>
For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.
